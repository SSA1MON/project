A bug is a **demonstrable, reproducible problem** that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

  1. Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.

  2. Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest `develop` branch in the repository.

  3. Isolate the problem - you NEED to provide a live example — ideally also create a reduced test case. This [CodePen](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/prvbMp), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/h8x8bvn9/2/) and [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/bojonaceve/2/edit?html,js,output) are helpful templates you can fork or clone.
